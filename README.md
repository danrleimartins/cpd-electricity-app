# cpd-electricity-app

Development Environment: The application should be developed using Node, NW.js or Electron frameworks.
Part I
1) Design a cross-platform desktop application for electricity users using a wireframe or any other appropriate design technique.
2) Develop and implement an application using nw.js or electron framework that calculates the electricity bill by adding VAT (13.5%) and Standing charges (4 cents per day).
3) Calculate the electricity bill using a unit rate (flat rate of 20 cents per unit), add standing charges at a rate of 4 cents per day and apply the VAT tariff at a rate of 13.5% to the total amount. The example for the calculation is mentioned below
‒ Input/ Output for Electricity Bill
‒ Number of Units: 225
‒ Billing Period (Days): 60
‒ Amount of Bill without VAT: 225 * 0.20 + 60 * 0.04 = 47.4
‒ Total payable amount including VAT (13.5%): 47.4 + 47.4 * 13.5/100 = 47.4 + 6.40 = €53.80 (Rounded values up to 2 decimal places)
4) Execute the application on your system (Windows/ Linux/ Mac) and provide the screenshots in the report.
5) The desktop application should show the title with your studentIDs, the images for the folder and files in this Electricity application.
6) Provide a clear strategy for testing desktop applications using Unit Testing or any other related technique/tool and validate for the users.
7) Demonstrate the desktop application code (JavaScript, HTML, package.json and CSS files) and its working functionality using a video presentation.
